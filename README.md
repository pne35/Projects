# 🧠 My Projects Portfolio  
A collection of coding, mathematics, and quantitative finance projects.  
This repository is structured to showcase three key strengths:  
**algorithmic problem-solving**, **mathematical reasoning**, and **quantitative modelling**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🔹 `algorithms-leetcode/`
Efficient solutions to selected LeetCode problems, written with clean code and optimised algorithms.  
Focus areas:
- Data structures  
- Dynamic programming  
- Graphs  
- Strings & arrays  
- Algorithmic reasoning  

This folder demonstrates speed, clarity, and problem-solving ability — essential in quant and SDE interviews.

---

### 🔹 `project-euler/`
Solutions to Project Euler challenges, prioritising mathematical insight and numerical methods.  
Focus areas:
- Number theory  
- Combinatorics  
- Optimisation  
- Mathematical programming  
- Elegant algorithm design  

Euler problems highlight mathematical maturity and creativity.

### 🔹 `quantitative-methods/`
A growing collection of models and simulations used in quantitative finance, probability, and stochastic processes.

Current or planned topics include:

#### 🟦 Stochastic Processes
- Poisson process (homogeneous and non-homogeneous)  
- Exponential inter-arrival times  
- Markov chains  
- Random walks  
- Brownian motion & Geometric Brownian Motion  

#### 🟧 Monte Carlo Methods
- Monte Carlo integration  
- Option pricing via simulation  
- European call/put estimates  
- Variance reduction techniques (future)  

#### 🟩 Financial Modelling
- Time-series transformations  
- Volatility estimation  
- Simple trading strategies  
- Backtesting frameworks  

Each subfolder contains code, visualisations, and a short explanation.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repo serves as:
- A demonstration of quantitative reasoning  
- A portfolio for internships and academic opportunities  
- A record of mathematical progress  
- A place to experiment with financial models and algorithms  
- A growing body of work designed for long-term skill development  

It is built to reflect the core skills used in quant roles:
- **mathematical modelling**  
- **fast and clean coding**  
- **stochastic simulation**  
- **data analysis and optimisation**

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
Planned additions:

- Black-Scholes Monte Carlo estimator  
- Stochastic Differential Equation solvers  
- Volatility modelling (GARCH)  
- Order-book simulation  
- Multi-factor trading models  
- Probability puzzles & interview-style reasoning  
- Optimised C++ implementations  

This repository will continue expanding as I complete more LeetCode, Euler, and quant projects.
