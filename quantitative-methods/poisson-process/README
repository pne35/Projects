Poisson Processes & Exponential Waiting Times
Overview

This project documents my understanding and implementation of Poisson processes, a fundamental stochastic model used in quantitative finance. I focus on both the mathematical foundations and practical simulation techniques used in quant work, market microstructure, and risk modelling.

A Poisson process is used to model events that:

Occur randomly in time

Are independent of previous events

Have a constant average rate λ

Allow at most one event in an infinitesimally small interval

Have exponential waiting times between events

Understanding these principles is essential for modelling limit order arrivals, price jumps, default events, and other market phenomena.

1. Mathematical Foundations
1.1 Event Probability in a Small Interval

For a small time interval Δt:

Probability of one event:
P(1 event in Δt)=λΔt

Probability of zero events:
P(0 events)=1−λΔt

Probability of two or more events is negligible:
P(≥2 events)≈0 (order (Δt)

This “no multiple events in a tiny interval” assumption is what allows the Poisson process to emerge.

1.2 Deriving the Probability of No Events in Time 𝑡

Divide time t into n small pieces, each of length:
Δt= t/n
	
Probability of no events in one interval: 1−λΔt

Probability of no events in all n intervals: (1−λΔt)^n

Taking the limit as n→∞ (Δ𝑡→0):

lim  (1−𝜆𝑡/𝑛)^𝑛= e^−λt
⁡𝑛→∞

This gives the core formula:

P(no events in time t)=e^−λt

1.3 Exponential Waiting Times

The time until the next event, 
T, is exponentially distributed:
P(T>t)=e^−λt

Expected waiting time:
E[T]=1/λ
	​
This exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning the process “forgets” how long it’s been since the last event. This property is unique to the exponential distribution, which is why Poisson processes are widely used in modelling markets.

2. Why This Matters in Quant Finance

Poisson processes appear in:

Limit order arrivals

Market orders hitting the book

Jump-diffusion models

Credit defaults / counterparty risk

Order flow imbalance models

Operational risk event modelling

High-frequency market microstructure

Even when real markets are more complicated, Poisson/exponential models form the backbone of many first-approximation models.

3. Simulation (Python)

This folder will include code that demonstrates:

Sampling interarrival times using:

T=−1/λ*ln(U)

Simulating a Poisson process by accumulating exponential waiting times

Using vectorized NumPy simulations

Plotting histograms vs. theoretical distributions

Simulating order arrivals with a given λ

These simulations help connect the maths to real data and real quant applications.
